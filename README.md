### Plan
Steps:
- Figure out how to store the game board as an array inside an object...
- Create the player objects, and the main game object to keep score/track of blocks filled
- Add the HTML to tie the array input to a grid design 
    add the functionality then to this to allow players to click on a square and fill it in with their marker
- Add the scoring logic if not already done in step 2
- Clean up interface and design, make it pretty
- Have a go at creating the AI opponent
